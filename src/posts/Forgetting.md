Sometimes, I look through the "Memories" Apple Photos presents to me and I'm delightlyfffully surprsied by how quickly I can place myself back in the meoment a picture was taken with.

This feeling of is part relief, "Sigh, I still do remember things."

ThisThe fear of I feel a bit uncomfortinablnk it's this is a real fear I cararr

This feeling is part relief from the fear I carry. The fear that I am forgetting more than I used to.

I notice this fear when I try to recall something that seems to be just beyond my "grasp."

The curious thing is that this fear, for me, often surfaces around information, abstract things

Although, what I’m coming to realize or wonder is whether it’s the tools we use that are not necessarily causing us to forget but preventing us from making memories with/within them

because these tools do not encode a revisiting practice, I wonder the extent to which this forgetting is simply our brains s offloading something from our short term memories but without the reminder / prompt to revisit, maybe it’s easy to assume the memory is no longer there

And so this fear/thought perpetuates itself

Perhaps i / people stat to assume this is actually us that is breaking.
And rather than asking more / differently from the tools themselves, we carry the responsibility for the perceived loss and that doesn’t feel good
