Permanence, memory, and place are three concepts that have been 


what i might be trying to say:
1. permanence is what makes memory and reinterpreation of the past possible
2. permanence is a letting go, a letting go of control of what is perceived
3. permanence establishes cotext, makes patt

The above came to me while working with Carolyn to define the objectives for what is now [mediawiki.org/Greenhouse experiment](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Greenhouse_experiment).

As we were going over the draft for the page, we paused on the bit I quoted above. There seemend to be something provocative about the pairing of "sketching" and "permanence." It was almost as if positioning them as compliments defied an implicit assumption about their mutual exclusivitity.

Permanence is a defining feature of MediaWiki. 

As a user of MediaWiki, pretty much everything you do with it is logged for anyone who is motivated to see.<sup>[i]</sup> 

When I first started working with MediaWiki, each edit felt high stakes to me. It was like every action I took expanded the amount of surface I needed to be able to account for and one day, be able to defend. In other words, this was not a tool I felt comfortable thinking with. 

In getting to know the tools, the projects, and cultures that have emerged atop MediaWiki, the sense of preciousness I felt at first has given way to an ease... a permissiveness that is inspiring me to sketch without worry.<sup>[ii]</sup>
