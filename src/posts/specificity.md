**I heard** Lin-Manuel Miranda dismiss the tension people describe between making a film about something specific and its potential for broad appeal.<sup>[i]</sup>

**Since hearing** Miranda name specificity as a property common among impactful creative work, I started noticing other people making a similar observation.<sup>[ii][iii][iv]</sup> 

**This observation** holds true for many things that have moved me. Now, I'm curious why. _Why might specificity continue to show up in work that affects me? Why had I instinctively accepted specificity to be in tension with appeal? Why is specificity even something that feels notable enough to talk about?_

**I’m motivated** to sketch answers to these questions to see if "specificity" generalizes to the ideas I work with. And if so, I would like to  hold myself accountable to being more specific.

**In short**, I think specificity shows up in work that impacts me because specificity creates potential. 

**The potential** for me, you, or anyone else receiving the work, to see and feel the message its creators are expressing through it. And with a coherent message embedded legibly within the work, all kinds of opportunities get unlocked.

**We can**:
* See the idea 
* Hear the idea
* Touch the idea
* Ask questions about the idea
* Sense how the idea makes us feel
* Describe the idea
* Relate the idea to our experiences
* Recognize opportunities to share the idea
* Remember the idea
* Use the idea
* Build on the idea

**It’s notable** to me how each of the potentialities listed above is open-ended. They do not suggest what happens next. Said another way: while specificity creates the potential for us to understand, experience, and talk about an idea, a specific idea does not have the ability to control the ways in which we react to it. By definition, we can resonate with and build on a specific idea as easily as we can dismiss it as insignificant and declare it "wrong."

_So what might contribute to the perception that specificity and wide appeal are mutually exclusive?_

**For one**, I wonder if few people have directly experienced the evolution of an idea specific enough to fit "inside" of a feeling in one person's body or small enough to fit inside of a single sentence in one person’s mind, to something that is resonant enough to become real. Real enough for people to to perceive the idea as a fixture of reality. And without many people experiencing this kind of evolution, the language to describe it and the knowledge to reproduce it is slow to develop and propogate. We do not walk around seeing the sentences and feelings the ideas emerged form, we see whole objects and the impact they have on us. 

**As a result**, we conflate an idea's potential impact with its size and choose to explore "big ideas."" We are not practied at holding and working with small, specific ideas.

_Now, why is specificity even something that feels notable enough to talk about?_

I think what it looks like to be specific varies from idea-to-idea and even more so between media. I also think being specific is inherently risky. 

In these ways, I think I meet specificifity anew each time I begin a project. 

Specificity, the principle, is always on my mind mind being specific is a practice, a skill that we are needing to deploy in ever-evovling environments. Specificity is never acquired.<sup>[v]</sup> 

**In my experience**, each new project or idea begins with a fairly noisy period. "Noisy" in the sense that a particularly compelling idea is generative...there are so many things I want and think the idea could say! Also "noisy" in the sense that at this early stage, I am often without a prototype that is resonant enough for me to cue off, to know and respect its boundaries well enough to know what to say "no" to.

In this way, specificity is something 



Without a prototype, script, sketch, etc., we lack the boundaries to say "no." We lack the 

there are so many things an idea could "say" and 


Because ideas, and the media thorugh which we express them, exist in environments that are you constantly evolving<sup>[v]</sup>,An idea that was effective at delivering a message at one point in time, might lose its potency 


For an idea to be specific, it needs to be constantly managed. 


- it's never quite "achieved"; it's constantly needing to be lost and reacquired
- it becomes more difficult to be specific the more complex an idea becomes; making things cohere and compress down into a coherent whole is hard
- saying no a lot

i. _"We invariably found, first of all, with the research just into Colombian music and literature, the more specific we went, and we drilled down on those rhythms and those cultures, the more unique a story we were telling. But also, the more specific the concerns, the more relatable they are.”_ | [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin-Manuel_Miranda) in conversation with [Elvis Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Mitchell) on [KCRW's The Treatment](https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/the-treatment/lin-manuel-miranda-tick-tick-boom-and-encanto)

ii. _“To me the specific is the most universal. Because it’s so deeply rooted in your experience that you could be talking about your life and your lineage and the things you’ve overcome and somebody who’s from a completely different cultural perspective and different generation can resonate with that.”_ | [John Batiste]() in conversation on [The Broken Record](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/broken-record/jon-batiste)

iii. _“I think everyone wants to make something touchable, but most of us don’t out of fear of being laughable. I’m not saying I’m fearless.”_ | [Jenny Zhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Zhang_(writer)) writing in [How it Feels](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/articles/70231/how-it-feels_)

If a snare is banging (BOP!) that's gonna hit you, you know and just gonna make your neck snap. you feel that snare snap it's gonna make you neck snap." | [Chad Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Hugo) describing [production and mapping sound to movement](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx474XBuef3gRBAoxfjgDldHAXyJVOpnnD)

v. “Dancing on a tightrope requires that one maintain an equilibrium from one moment to the next by recreating it at every step by means of new adjustments; it requires one to maintain a balance that is never permanently acquired; constant readjustments renews the balance while giving the impression of ‘keeping it’.” [Michel de Certeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Certeau) writing in the ["The Practice of Everyday Life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life)

v. E.g. The the minds of people who are working on the idea, the minds of people who are receiving and applying the idea, the social/organizations structure that supports the idea,  etc.)
