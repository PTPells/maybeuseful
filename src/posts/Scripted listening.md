When you listen for an answer, you are looking for something specific. You have a boundary in mind for what does and does not fit.

Said in another way: you are listening with a script in-hand, closed off to what is present and potentially, fresh and new.

I think this is something important for me to consider as I think about making on my own...

I wonder: _How might I become a bit more aware of when and why I decide to say "no" to ideas that emerges when I'm making on my own?_
