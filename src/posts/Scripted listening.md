When you listen for an answer, you are looking for something specific. You have a boundary in mind for what does and does not fit within it.

Said in another way: you are listening with a scriptt, through the past rather than listening for what is present and potentially fresh and new.

I think this is something important for me to consider as I think about resonance...

I wonder how much I get in my own way when working on personal projects because I am too quick to judge and reject resonance because I do not see a place for it within what I already deciding I'm seeking.
