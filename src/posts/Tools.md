> "I think it’s important to also consider a *tool* broadly … like you said, even a word (“ping”) can be a tool for thought. A specific process or methodology can be a tool as well. Could a community be a tool as well, or is that taking it too far? Whatever it is, it seems you’re interested in helping people ground in their own experience, and there are various ways to do that. (Btw, would be fun to define “tool” together, or to figure out if it’s better to use a different word.)"

> "One thing to ponder, is there a way to describe this other than "the tool"? Giving it a working title, or calling it "the app". Wondering if people think of apps as tools specifically? Or maybe it's good to call it a tool and ground it in those terms? Just wanting intentionality around that point."


...when I say tool, what am I trying to communicate? Why might I gravitate toward the term "tool"? What clues does "tool" hold?
