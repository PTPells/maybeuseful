I love metaphor for its capacity to help myself and others transcend, to **begin to be** in new places and spaces.<sup>[i]</sup>

I also find metaphor's power to be seductive. In this sketch, I'm going to try to bring some shape to meatphor's power and limitations so that I can use it responsibly.

**Power**
- Metaphor can help us to understand and, by extension, work with  _one_ particular aspect or facet of something new



**Limitations**
- Something new, distinct, fresh, etc. can never be fully explained, expressed, or undrestood through metaphor.<sup>[iii]</sup>

**Implications**
- Depending too heavily on metaphor to get a handle on something fresh causes you to reproduce the basis for the metaphor 
- Depending too heavily on a single metaphor will preclude you from seeing the other facets of the thing you're trying to get a handle on that the metahpor can not hold/explain

i. _...ordinary words convey only what we know already; it is from metaphor that we can best get hold of something fresh._ [Aristotle quoted by Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By)

ii. _A metaphorical structuring of a concept, say the JOURNEY metaphor for arguments, allows us to get a handle on one aspect of the concept. Thus a metaphor works when it satisfies a purpose, namely, understanding an aspect of the concept._ [George Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By)_


iii. _At its root all language has the character of metaphor, because no matter what it intends to be about it remains language, and remians absolutely unlike whatever it is about. This means that we can never have the falcon, only the word 'falcon.' To say that we have the falcon, and nothe the 'falcon,' is to presume again that we know precisely what it is we have, that we can see it in its entirety, and that we can speak as nature itself._

_Words are complex systems of metaphors and symbols that translate experience into our uttered or outered senses. They are a technology of explicitness._ [Marshall McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media)
