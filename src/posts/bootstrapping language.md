_A metaphorical structuring of a concept, say the JOURNEY metaphor for arguments, allows us to get a handle on one aspect of the concept. Thus a metaphor works when it satisfies a purpose, namely, understanding an aspect of the concept._ [George Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By)


> ... our imagination does not create within its outlines but creates the outlines themselves


_...ordinary words convey only what we know already; it is from metaphor that we can best get hold of something fresh._ [Aristotle quoted by Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By)


_Words are complex systems of metaphors and symbols that translate experience into our uttered or outered senses. They are a technology of explicitness._ [Marshall McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media)
