> _How do you arrive back into thinking about something at work after time away?_

In short, the primary way i help myself reassemble the context I need to become present in thinking about a piece (or “body”) of work after some time way is by equipping my future self with the context it needs to arrive back into the space and navigate within it.


_Emphasis on “navigate” for movement and navigation are metaphors i heavily depend on to conceptualize how i think. more on this below._

 
For me, "...equipping my future self with the context it needs to arrive back into the space and navigate within it" amounts to answering questions like the below.

_Note: it's key to sketch answers to these questions while you're still "in" the work, before you've "left."_


1. **Why am i “here”?** 

> _What motivated me to think about this thing in the first place? What am i trying to decide? What new information am i trying to integrate? What uncertainty am i needing to make sense of?_

2. **Where am i trying to “go”?** 

> _What question(s) am I trying to answer? What am I trying to learn? What impact am i trying to have? etc._


3. **Where have i been?**

> _What have i already tried? What do i know? What have i decided? What do i assume? What have i not yet been able to answer/figure out?_

4. **What context clues can i use to help navigate?** 

> _What assumptions, hypotheses, prior work, etc. informed what i’ve come to think? See "3."_

Core to doing what i described above is seeing the value in the effort of externalizing what you’re currently able to hold in short-term memory because you can see/anticipate a future wherein that short-term memory is now holding other things.
