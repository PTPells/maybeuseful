To be “here for the first time” is a posture, a way of showing up, and a way of _choosing_ to be.

When you are “here for the first time” you approach and engage motivated to learn, eager to listen, ready to play, and resilient enough to exist in the uncertain.

Crucially, being “here for the first time” requires that you acknowledge how our varying histories and experiences impact what we each need to overcome in order to feel safe enough to be curious and to question.

When you are “here for the first time” you let go of knowing and arrive into experiencing.

It is brave to show when you do not know.
