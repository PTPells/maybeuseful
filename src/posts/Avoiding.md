Last Sunday, around 1pm today, I was seated at our table, finishing a snack, while glancing at the couch in the front room, envisioning myself seated with my feet up, wiht a cup of coffee to my side and finishing some writing I’d been putting off/ambiently preparing for all week. 

_([I was wanting to finsih a draft of the narrative to introduce the tool [David](davidgoligorsky.com) and I have been working on.)_



I then thought, “Hmm, I know the combination of the knobby carpet plus the 3-legged stool can make picking things up and putting things down feel too precarious for my liking.”

Naturally, my mind went to, “what a great time to make a prototype of the little side table I’ve had in my head and that Sara’s talked about us needing.”

And so, I got to making.

I was going to give myself 15 minutes to get the legs on. After that, I’d make some cinnamon water and get to writing. 

The legs went on quicker than I imagined and I wasn’t mad at how it was looking. Energized, I thought, “let me just cut off those edges. ”

The jagged sides came off.

“Ok! This will work!!” I joyfully thought. “Now, let me sand down those rough edges” 

I tried sanding and it was going kind of slow.

“Hmmm, maybe it’d be more efficient to knock down the edges with the little hand plane I have?”

“Oh, woah…this things is really pulling off some material. I’m not sure i’ve ever felt this fluid using this.”

I really leaned into that little plane and ended up with a pretty pronounced chamfer. “Cool! I like it! Let me do a bit more sanding and take some photos of this thing.”

Photos.

2.5 hours later, I’m on the couch, writing this and picking up and placing down a cup filled with cinnamon water without worry. 

Did the table turn into a convenient way to avoid what I’d originally intended to do today? Did I find a pocket to improvise within and surrender to it? Will the lightness I feel now be later replaced by the stuckness I’d felt all week leading up to this? Will it create the space I didn’t know I needed to get into the writing I’d originally planned to do today?

…I’m not sure. Tho, I wonder if a way of becoming more practiced at understanding what an instinct is by surrendering to them, seeing what happens, and bringing that learning into the next time.
