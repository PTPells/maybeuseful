When Sara and I can't sleep, we will sometimes play the game described below.

We've also played the game in small transitional moments <sup>[i]</sup> with friends, colleagues, and younger cousins.<sup>[ii]</sup>

In our experiences, the game produces shared moments of delight, surprise, pride, anticipation, and accomplishment. 


#### objective
As a group, your objective is to name three “things” that begin with  each letter of the alphabet that fit within the category the group defines before the game begins. 

Before the group can move on to the next letter, you all need to agree that you have identified three "things" that begin with the letter that is currently in play.

#### gameplay
1. As a group, pick a **{category}** for which you will come up with things that belong to it. _E.g. "Things people are afraid of"_
2. For each letter of the alphabet, the group needs to generate **{3}** "things" that they agree fit within the cateogry.<sup>iii</sup> _All games start with the letter A._

3. Once the group finds three items that begin with the letter they’re on, they move on to the next letter and repeat the process until they make it through all 26 letters in the alphabet.

4. ✅ That's it!

_If play the game and use a category that you had fun with, please [send me a message](mailto:peter@pelberg.com?subject=Alphabet%20game) or [add it directly to this are.na board](https://www.are.na/share/rPBJbNB)._





#### notes
-  **There is no order.** As soon as you have an idea, say it! The game is about generating lots of ideas and reaching a consensus about inclusion quickly.

- **Use your voice.** If at any point, you are uncertain that what someone is proposing belongs to the category that is in play, challenge it! When this happens, the player who proposed the idea has two options: 
> - A) Pitch the group on why they think the idea they are proposing belongs. _If the player chooses  this route, the group then decides whether the rationale the proposing player offered is strong enough for the proposal to be accepted into the category._ 

> _or_ 

> - B) Retract the proposal and keep thinking of other ideas. 

- **Find the boundaries.** If you think of an idea that _could_ fit, try it out and see how people react! Defining the possibility space together is part of the gameplay.
