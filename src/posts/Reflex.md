Today, Natalia shared ["not quiet as in quiet but"](https://onbeing.org/poetry/not-quiet-as-in-quiet-but/) with me, a poem by Victoria Adukwei Bulley.

Along with it, Natalia prompted me to think about a word that has been on my mind and to try writing a poem to/for it.

The word that immediately comes up for me: Reflex.


...reflex   
as in automatic  
as in instant   
as in instinctive  
as in *“why did you respond that way?”*    
as in single-track  
as in thoughtless  
as in mechanical    
as in impulsive   
as in messy  
as in *“might there have been another way?”*   
as in frozen  
as in afraid  
as in small  
as in unclear and indirect  
as in out of the way  
as in *“why did you stay stuck?*   
as in intuitive   
as in spontaneous  
as in necessary   
as in *“aren’t you proud?”*  
...reflex.

I'm coming to trust that the reflexes I develop, shape how I think and feel and the impact I have.

I'm also becoming clear about wanting to hold myself accountable to acting on the reflexes that bring me closer to what I need and and resisting the reflexes that I think will help me move away from what I fear. 

Publishing this is an act in service of the former.
