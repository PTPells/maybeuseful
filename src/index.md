# maybe <br> useful
I imagine maybe useful as a little cedar-shingled studio I built in my backyard.

Inside, it is warm, bright, and cozy. There are sketches strewn about and reminders tacked to the walls. 

Outside, birds and bees buzz about under the warm sun.

I consider maybe useful an experiment in creating a place for me to go. A place where I can work out what I’m thinking and remind myself of where I’ve been.

Please <a href="/posts">come in</a> and [be in touch](mailto:peter@pelberg.com?subject=maybe%20useful) if anything here touches you. 

I'm delighted you stopped by ☀️
