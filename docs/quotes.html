    <strong>Kanye West</strong>: <i><a title="home" href=".">TBD</a></i>
    <div class="quote">
      <p> I know I don’t know. If i thought i did. I’d put out<br>
       some bullshit. The fact that I know that I’m not on that<br>
       level right now, gives me the area to learn. It’s ike<br>
       being a child. Because I'm alway looking. Searching for<br>
       new shit. Alway looks for art in everything. As you make<br>
       more you always see something else. The point when you're<br>
       satisfied is when you’re dead. You should never be completely<br>
       satisfied.

    <div class="quote">
      <p> ...blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts<br>
       to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't<br>
       even know he's locked up.

   <strong>Andrew L. Shapiro</strong>: <i><a title="home" href="http://motspluriels.arts.uwa.edu.au/MP1801as.html#bev)">Freedom from Speech</a></i>
   <div class="quote">
     <p>Though the Net empowers us as speakers, it<br>
     empowers us as listeners even more. We need<br>
     never be "captives" subject to speech we<br>
     don't want to hear.

   </i>
   <div class="quote">
     <p>Dancing on a tightrope requires that one maintain an<br>
      equilibrium from one moment to the next by recreating<br>
      it at every step by means of new adjustments; it requires<br>
      one to maintain a balance that is never permanently acquired;<br>
      constant readjustments renews the balance whole giving the<br>
      impression of ‘keeping it’.

   <strong>Masanobu Fukuok</strong>: <i><a title="home" href="One Straw Revolution">One Straw Revolution</a></i>
   <div class="quote">
     <p> Eventually I decided to give my thoughts a form, to<br>
       put them into practice, and so to determine whether my<br>
       understanding was right or wrong.

   <div class="quote">
     <p> Initially what is important is to be able to<br>
     successfully make a useful object over which the<br>
    maker can exclaim, with pleasure and amazement,<br>
    "I made this myself!"

     </a></i>
   <div class="quote">
     <p> We get to the point where we cannot describe our<br>
       impression of an object without treating it as a living<br>
      thing with its own physiognomy. For even the most precise<br>
       description, enumerating all visible characteristics, will<br>
       not give an inkling what we feel is the essence of the<br>
      thing itself. Just as we do not notice the individual<br>
      letters in a word but receive a total impression of the<br>
      idea the word conveys, we generally are not aware of what<br>
      it is that we perceive but only of the conception created<br>
      in our minds when we perceive it.

    <strong>Why the Lucky Stiff</strong>: <i><a title="home" href=".">.

    <div class="quote">
      <p>When you don't create things, you become defined by<br>
         your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only <br>
         narrow & exclude people. so create

    <strong>Donald Judd</strong>: <i>Source</i>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>Usually when someone says a thing is too simple, they're<br>
      saying that certain familiar things aren't there, and <br>
      they're seeing a couple maybe that are left, which they<br>
      count as a couple, that's all.

    <strong>Italo Calvino</strong>: <i><a title="home" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/invisible-cities/oclc/802505145">Invisible Cities</a></i>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>I could tell you how many steps make up the streets<br>
        rising like stairways, and the degree of the arcades'<br>
        curves, and what kind of zinc scales cover the roofs;<br>
        but I already know this would be the same as telling<br>
        you nothing. The city does not consist of this, but of<br>
        relationships between the measurements of its space and <br>
        the events of its past.

   <strong>James C. Scott</strong>: <i><a title="home" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/seeing-like-a-state-how-certain-schemes-to-improve-the-human-condition-have-failed/oclc/37392803">Seeing Like a State</a></i>
   <div class="quote">
     <p> State simplifications such as maps, censuses, cadastral<br>
        list, and standard unites of measurement represent<br>
        techniques for grasping a large and complex reality;<br>
        in order for officials to be able to comprehend aspects<br>
        of the ensemble, that complex reality must be reduced to<br>
        schematic categories. The only way to accomplish this is<br>
        to reduce an infinite array of detail to a set of<br>
        categories that will facilitate summary descriptions,<br>
        comparisons and aggregation.

     <strong>Robert Greene</strong>: <i><a title="home" href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/mastery/oclc/779263539)">Mastery</a></i>
     <div class="quote">
       <p> If we feel like we know something, our minds close<br>
      off to other possibilities. We see reflections of the<br>
      truth we’ve already assumed. Such feeling of superiority<br>
      are often unconscious and stem from a fear of<br>
     what is different or unknown.

   <h3>2015</h3>
     <strong>Bret Victor</strong>: <i><a title="home" href="http://worrydream.com/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThought/note.html#:~:text=One's%20ability%20to%20articulate%20an,still%20to%20say%20it%20oneself.">A note about "The Humane Representation of
       <br>Thought"</a></i>
     <div class="quote">
       <p> One's ability to articulate an idea always lags behind<br>
         the understanding of the idea, and the understanding of<br>
         an idea often lags behind the embodiment in which it is<br>
         first given life. It can take a surprising amount of time<br>
         to come to understand what a prototype is trying to "say",<br>
         and longer still to say it oneself.
