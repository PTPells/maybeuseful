  <h2>Being specific</h2>
  <p>

  </p>
    </a>
    <p>I heard Lin Manuel Miranda dismiss the tension<br>
      people describe between making something specific<br>
      its potential for universal appeal.<sup>[i]</sup><sup>[ii]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since hearing Miranda name specificity as a property<br>
      common among impactful work, I started noticing<br>
      other people making a similar observation. <br>

    </p>
    <p>
      This observation describes my experinece<br>
      and I’m curious why this is so. <i>Why<br>
      might specificity continue to show up in<br>
      work that affects people? What does work<br>
      that is specific feel like? Why have I felt<br>
      challenged by being specific? Why does specificity<br>
      tend to be cast as being in tension with appeal?<br>
      Why is specificity even something that feels notable<br>
      enough to talk about?</i>

    </p>
    <p>
      I’m motivated to sketch answers to these<br>
      questions so that I can hold myself<br>
      accountable to being specific in what I<br>
      make and say. I also want to develop the<br>
      awareness to notice when I'm not being specific  <br>
      and become curious about why this might be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, I think specificity is common among<br>
      impactful ideas beacuse to be specific there must <br>
      be something real and inside of that reality is potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential for people “receiving” the work<br>
      to see and feel the reality its “creators” have<br>
      experienced and are attempting to communicate through <br>
      it. And with a clear message embedded legibly within<br>
     the work, people can do all sorts of things.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      People can:
      <ul>
        <li>See the idea</li>
        <li>Visit the reality the idea lives within</li>
        <li>Relate the idea to their experience</li>
        <li>Sense how the idea makes them feel</li>
        <li> Imagine themselves integrating the<br>
        idea into their life</li>
        <li> Form an opinion for if/how integrating<br>
        the idea into their life would impact them</li>
        <li>Describe the idea using language that<br>
        feels intuitive to them</li>
        <li>Recognize the opportunities to share the<br>
        idea with others</li>
        <li>Combine the idea with something they<br>
        have thought about</li>
        <li>Remember the idea</li>
        <li>Decide whether they will allow the idea to<br>
        change them</li>
        <li>Evolve how they see and understand the reality<br>
          they experience</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s notable to me how each of the scenarios listed above <br>
      is open-ended. They do not suggest what happens next. <br>
      While specificity creates the potential for people <br>
      to understand, experience, and talk about an idea,<br>
      a specific idea does not have the ability<br>
      to control the ways in which people react and handle it.<br>
      By definition, people can reonsate with and build on an<br>
      idea that is specific as easily as they can criticize<br>
      it, dismiss it as small, and declare it "wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it's the fear of experienceing the second half of<br>
      the sentence above that can sometimes scare me away of being<br>
      specific.<br>
      <br>
      #TODO:
      <ul>
      -talk about how being speciifc is dependent upon being
      confident in one's experience for without it, we
      depend on other peoples' receptiveness to specificity
      to validate on our own existence
      - talk about how writing this has prompted me to
      ask myself "when do i become specific and with whom?"
      - talk about how for a specific to have the potential
      to become specific it needs to be given the opportunity
      to interact with other peoples' experiences to see if it
      resonates
      - the idea also needs to be able to evovle while still
      retaining the quality of being speciifci




      When I combine the new awareness I'm coming to develop for of<br>
      control inherent in react to ideas that are specific with the doubt<br>
      I felt in my experience and the awarness and<br>
      language I was missing to undersatnd this doubt, two<br>
      things become clear to me:


      <ol>
        <li> Being specific begets intimacy and vulnerability</li>
        <li> Being generic produces distance and elusiveness</li>
      </ol>
    And maybe this intimacy and vulnerability offer clues about why<br>
    specificity and the tension it brings up with people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to the questions I started with:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Why do poeple tend to cast specificity<br>
        as being in tension with impact?</i></li>
        <li><i>Why is specificity even notable<br>
        enough to talk about?</i></li><br>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>

    <i>Notes</i>
    <br>
    i. I'm saying "things" in this context to refer to software,<br>
     physical tools, film, music, memes...anything that people<br>
     <i>choose</i> to engage with.
   ii. Link to "The Treatment" episode and timestamp

    <p>
      LOOSE<br>
      I wonder if this has to do with the culture in which specificity is being discussed.
      Perhaps, the culture that is developing ideas does not have memory of haivng
      created something from scratch that's been impactful. and with that
      experience they lack the conviction to "stand" in specificity.

      I also wonder whether when people say an idea needs to be bigger,
      what they're actually talking about is the ambition of the idea,
      and the impact htey hope it to have rather than about the idea itself.
