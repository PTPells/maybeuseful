  <h3>Being specific</h3>
    <p>
      People have named specificity as a <br>
      property common among impactful ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This observation describes my experinece<br>
      and I’m curious why this is so. <i>Why<br>
      might specificity continue to show up in<br>
      work that impacts people? What does work<br>
      that is specific feel like?  Why do poeple<br>
      tend to cast specificity as being in<br>
      tension with impact? Why is specificity<br>
      even notable enough to talk about?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m motivated to sketch answers to these<br>
      questions so that I can hold myself<br>
      accountable to being specific in what I<br>
      make. I also want to develop the awareness<br>
      to notice when I'm not being specific and <br>
      become curious about why this might be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, I think specificity is common among<br>
      impactful ideas beacuse specificity creates<br>
      potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential for people “receiving” the work<br>
      to see and feel the message its “creators” are<br>
      attempting to communicate through it. And with<br>
      a clear message embedded legibly within the work,<br>
      people can do all sorts of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      People can:
      <ul>
        <li>Relate the idea to their experience</li>
        <li>Sense how the idea makes them feel</li>
        <li> Imagine themselves integrating the<br>
        idea into their life</li>
        <li> Form an opinion for if/how integrating<br>
        the idea into their life would impact them</li>
        <li>Describe the idea using language that<br>
        feels intuitive to them</li>
        <li>Recognize the opportunities to share the<br>
        idea with others</li>
        <li>Combine the idea with something they<br>
        have thought about</li>
        <li>Remember the idea</li>
        <li>Integrate the idea into their everyday life</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s notable to me how each of the scenarios listed above <br>
      is open-ended. They do not suggsest what happens next. <br>
      Said another way: while specificity creates the potential<br>
      for people to understand, evaluate, and talk<br>
      about an idea, a specific idea does not have the ability<br>
      to control the ways in which people react and handle it.<br>
      By definition, people can celebrete and relate to an<br>
      idea that is specific as easily as they can criticize<br>
      it and dismiss it as small.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I couple the uncertainty of how people might<br>
      react with how inertia can cause me to blur the<br>
      distinction between my self and the idea I have a part<br>
      in, two things become clear to me:
      <ol>
        <li> Being specific begets intimacy and vulnerability</li>
        <li> Being generic produces distance and elusiveness</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to the questions I started with:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Why do poeple tend to cast specificity<br>
        as being in tension with impact?</i></li>
        <li><i>Why is specificity even notable<br>
        enough to talk about?</i></li><br>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      LOOSE<br>
      I wonder if this has to do with the culture in which specificity is being discussed.
      Perhaps, the culture that is developing ideas does not have memory of haivng
      created something from scratch that's been impactful. and with that
      experience they lack the conviction to "stand" in specificity.

      I also wonder whether when people say an idea needs to be bigger,
      what they're actually talking about is the ambition of the idea,
      and the impact htey hope it to have rather than about the idea itself.
