  <h2>Maybe useful</h2>
    <p>
      If I consider the thinking I do privately to be done<br>
      at home, then I imagine this place to be the little<br>
      cedar-shingled studio I’ve built to learn and make<br>
      in the backyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s warm and cozy. When you come inside you'll<br>
      see sketches strewn about. Some sketches are in<br>
      notebooks that I haven't revisited in a while, others<br>
      are taped to the wall as reminders, and a few are still<br>
      warm from the touch of my left-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the sketches you see are prototypes I've made.<br>
      ...artifacts of moments where I've used what I've had<br>
      on hand to think through something.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also drawings other people have made in<br>
      here. These are tools that I’ve used and have<br>
      been inspired by.<br>
    </p>
      Please pick up whatever catches your eye. And if something<br>
      prompts a thought or question, I'd value you being in<br>
      touch about it.<br>
