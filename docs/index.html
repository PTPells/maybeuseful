  <h2>Maybe useful</h2>
    <p>
      If I consider the thinking<br>
      I do privately to be done<br>
      at home, then I imagine this<br>
      place to be the little cedar-<br>
      -shingled studio I’ve built to<br>
      learn and make in the backyard.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s warm cozy.<br>
      When you come inside,<br>
      you’ll see, tools strewn about.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the tools are prototypes<br>
      I’ve made...artifacts of moments<br>
      along a journey through something.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also tools other people<br>
      have made that I’ve used <br>
      and have inspired me.<br>
    </p>
      Please pick things up. If anything<br>
      here prompts thoughts or questions in you,<br>
      I'd value you being in touch about them.
