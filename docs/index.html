      If I consider the thinking I do 
      privately to be done at home, 
      then I imagine this place to be 
      the little, cedar-shingled studio I’ve built 
      to learn and make in the backyard.

      It’s warm and cozy. When you 
      come inside, you’ll see tools 
      strewn about.

    <para>
      Some of the tools are prototypes I’ve made; 
      artifacts of moments along a journey 
      with something.

      There are also tools other people have made 
      that I’ve used and have inspired me.

      Please pick things up and see if 
      and how they impact you. Be in touch 
      if anything here prompts new 
      thoughts or questions in you.
